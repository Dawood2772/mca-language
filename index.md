# MCA Language

**MCA** (or MCAssembly) is a programming language that compiles down the Minecraft Commands and redstone circuitry.

MCA is a _macro language_. This means that it runs during compile time, and outputs a set of commands (in MCIL).

Both MCA's syntax, and its common library, borrow features from Javascript.

An official MCA compiler which outputs [MCIL]({{site.baseurl}}/doc/mcil) code is available [on Github](https://github.com/toxic-spanner/mca-compiler/).
